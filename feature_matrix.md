# GenesisCode Feature Matrix (Audit Date: 2026-02-21)

Legend:
- `✅` = first-class and built into the primary language/toolchain surface
- `⚠️` = partial, optional, profile-gated, or primarily ecosystem-driven
- `❌` = not first-class in the primary language/toolchain itself

| Enforced runtime wall-time budgets for strict/full profile lanes | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Bidirectional requirements traceability (system/HLR/LLR -> code -> tests -> artifact) | ✅ (`gcpm trace` + `:requirements-trace` schema + fail-closed policy gates on refs/publish/registry) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

| Qualified-tool evidence bundles for regulated release | ✅ (`gcpm qualify` + `:tool-qualification` schema + fail-closed policy gates) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Independent verifier role-separation policy enforcement | ✅ (ref/publish policy classes support required roles + per-role minimums + independence pairs enforced on valid attestations) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

Notes:
- This compares first-class language/toolchain semantics, not total ecosystem power.
- GenesisCode is strongest on deterministic capability/evidence workflows and semantic VCS/pkg integration.
- Current main GenesisCode gaps are concentrated in non-`P0`/`P1` hardening and performance tuning lanes.
- Regulated-standard alignment status below is an engineering-readiness view, not a formal certification claim.

Regulated assurance readiness snapshot (indicative):
- `DO-178C DAL A/B`: ⚠️ partial alignment (requirements traceability, structural decision/MC/DC coverage, and tool qualification workflows are in place; formal process qualification and certification evidence packs remain open).
- `NASA NPR 7150.2 Class A/B`: ⚠️ partial alignment (deterministic runtime, traceability artifacts, role gates, and structural decision/MC/DC coverage are strong; independent IV&V process controls remain open).
- `IEC 62304 Class C`: ⚠️ partial alignment (lifecycle evidence/policy gates and qualification artifacts are in place; richer risk/coverage process mapping remains open).

Known GenesisCode gaps (current red-team focus):
- `P1.1` `release-full` hard-gate is not currently clippy-clean (`items_after_test_module` in obligations module layout).
- `P2.1` Selfhost artifact freshness guard still defaults to rebuild-based slow-path verification in normal flows.
- `P2.2` AI iteration SLO measurement is sensitive to host contention; perf-gate isolation/robustness needs hardening.
- `P2.3` GPU backend policy defaults can still mask fallback in generic runtime profile execution; release intent should be explicit.
- `P2.4` Documentation surface remains broad/overlapping for agent retrieval and needs canonical consolidation.
- `P2.5` Regulated-assurance readiness remains partial; certification-grade process evidence packs are not yet complete.
