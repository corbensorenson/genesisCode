# GenesisCode Feature Matrix (Audit Date: 2026-02-22)

Legend:
- `✅` = first-class and built into the primary language/toolchain surface
- `⚠️` = partial, optional, profile-gated, or primarily ecosystem-driven
- `❌` = not first-class in the primary language/toolchain itself

| Explicit selfhost-only execution mode | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Fully self-hosted toolchain with zero bootstrap-language dependency | ⚠️ (production binaries are selfhost-first with explicit deterministic artifact recovery from manifest sources; Rust parity remains isolated to dedicated parity harness artifacts) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Artifact-only bootstrap default across WASM host APIs | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Deterministic concurrency/task API with replay semantics | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| Media/asset pipeline contracts for AI-generated build lanes | ✅ (first-class `core/media::*` hash/image/audio transcode ops + policy gates + `core/kit/media::*` build contracts) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Device-backed GPU compute required in release profile | ✅ (policy and lane contracts require `device-runtime`; release/profile health execution now enforces full profile lanes instead of backlog short-circuit, and device conformance remains wired via release lane checks) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Network + process execution as policy-gated capabilities | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

| Plugin command surface hardening (command allowlists + bridge digest pinning) | ✅ (`host/plugin::command` and `editor/plugin::command` require `allow_commands`; bridge transport requires `bridge_cmd_sha256` and fails closed when missing/mismatched) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Browser runtime host profile for wasm-hosted apps | ✅ (first-party `browser/window::*`, `browser/input::*`, `browser/audio::*`, `browser/storage::*` families + `first_party_profile=\"browser\"` for gfx window/input/audio parity lanes) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ |

| WASI CLI support | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ |

| Deployment/bundle target pipeline in core toolchain | ⚠️ (`gcpm build --target <web|desktop|service|ios|android|edge|service-runtime>` emits deterministic runtime-runner bundles today (`runtime_contract/boot/smoke`); platform-native executable packaging/signing lanes remain open in P0.3) | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Workspace semantic graph/refactor API for automation | ✅ (`semantic-edit workspace-graph` + `semantic-edit refactor-plan` + `semantic-edit apply-plan` provide deterministic dependency graph export, machine-mergeable patch planning, and obligation-gated plan application with conflict diagnostics) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Machine-consumable agent authoring contract | ✅ (`docs/spec/WRITE_GENESISCODE_SKILL_v0.1.json` + `docs/spec/WRITE_GENESISCODE_SKILL_PACK_v0.1.json` + executable conformance gates `scripts/check_genesiscode_authoring_skill.sh`, `scripts/check_write_genesiscode_skill_pack.sh`, `scripts/check_write_genesiscode_skill_distribution.sh`, and `scripts/check_write_genesiscode_skill_conformance.sh`) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| Runtime backend profile selection through project manager workflows | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

| Generative workload regression gates with enforced historical baselines | ✅ (`agent_generative_workloads*` lanes are fail-closed with seeded baseline histories, per-case minimum-history enforcement, and active regression budgets in native/parity runs) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Enforced runtime wall-time budgets for strict/full profile lanes | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Perf/hot-path gate operability under constrained local disk headroom | ⚠️ (shared `GENESIS_PERF_DISK_STRICT_MODE=auto|1|0` exists, but recent gauntlet/help-surface runs still failed from temp/disk exhaustion; closure tracked in P0.2 + P1.5) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Health gate lock-aware cargo scheduling + shared build cache target | ✅ (`check_upgrade_plan_health.sh` partitions cargo/non-cargo gates, shares `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, and supports profile-scoped cargo warmup orchestration) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Bidirectional requirements traceability (system/HLR/LLR -> code -> tests -> artifact) | ✅ (`gcpm trace` + `:requirements-trace` schema + fail-closed policy gates on refs/publish/registry) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

| Qualified-tool evidence bundles for regulated release | ⚠️ (`gcpm qualify` emits tool-qualification artifacts, but caller-supplied `--test-artifact` hashes are not yet hard-bound to executed run lineage; closure tracked in P1.2) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Independent verifier role-separation policy enforcement | ✅ (ref/publish policy classes support required roles + per-role minimums + independence pairs enforced on valid attestations) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Standards-oriented assurance profile packs (DO-178C/NASA/IEC) | ⚠️ (`gcpm assurance-pack` profile lanes and deterministic crosswalk contracts exist, but high-assurance lineage/independence closure remains open in P1.2 + P2.2) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

Notes:
- This compares first-class language/toolchain semantics, not total ecosystem power.
- GenesisCode is strongest on deterministic capability/evidence workflows and semantic VCS/pkg integration.
- Red-team backlog currently contains active P0/P1 blockers; see `upgrade_plan.md`.
- Regulated-standard alignment status below is an engineering-readiness view, not a formal certification claim.

Regulated assurance readiness snapshot (indicative):
- `DO-178C DAL A/B`: ⚠️ partial alignment (requirements traceability, structural decision/MC/DC coverage, tool qualification workflows, and deterministic assurance-pack bundles are in place; formal certification program execution remains external to the language runtime/toolchain).
- `NASA NPR 7150.2 Class A/B`: ⚠️ partial alignment (deterministic runtime, traceability artifacts, role gates, structural coverage, and assurance-pack bundling are in place; independent mission IV&V process controls remain organizational responsibilities).
- `IEC 62304 Class C`: ⚠️ partial alignment (lifecycle evidence/policy gates, qualification artifacts, and reproducible assurance-pack bundles are in place; full device-risk process qualification remains product-program specific).

Known GenesisCode gaps:
- `P0.2`: GPU/GFX gauntlet workflows are not robust under constrained temp/disk headroom.
- `P0.3`: `gcpm build --target` emits runtime-runner contracts, not platform-native executable artifacts.
- `P1.2`: Tool qualification test artifacts are not cryptographically bound to executed test lineage.
- `P1.3`: `gcpm` dependency resolution remains local-only v0.1 without semver/range solving.
- `P1.4`: Production CLI help-surface gate p95 remains over budget without sufficient release-build reuse.
- `P1.5`: Heavy gate execution lacks shared disk-headroom preflight/recovery contracts.
- `P1.6`: High-churn Rust surfaces remain too large for optimal agent-first maintenance loops.
- `P1.7`: Documentation/peripheral guidance still needs consolidation into a tighter agent-first spine.
- `P1.8`: Bootstrap retirement and fallback removal policy is not fully closed for production enforcement.
- `P2.1`: Canonical `write_genesisCode_skill.md` + cross-agent conformance pack is not yet published.
- `P2.2`: Assurance packs require stronger object/lineage/independence closure for high-assurance programs.
- `P2.3`: Non-graphics GPU and XR/WebXR productization templates are not fully closed end-to-end.
