# GenesisCode Feature Matrix (Audit Date: 2026-02-25)

Last updated: 2026-02-25  
Scope: features that matter for agentic coding autonomy and selfhost reliability.

Legend:
- `✅` production-capable and validated in active gates
- `⚠️` available but with important closure/hardening debt

Known GenesisCode gaps identified in this audit (tracked in `/Users/corbensorenson/Documents/genesisCode/upgrade_plan.md`):
- `P0.1` - turnkey host backend provisioning for agent execution remains incomplete.
- `P0.2` - stage2 compiler coverage still does not cover arbitrary generated program forms.
- `P1.1` - WASI remote registry/sync parity still depends on out-of-band bridge bootstrapping.
