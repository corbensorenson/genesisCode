# GenesisCode Feature Matrix (Audit Date: 2026-02-25)

Last updated: 2026-02-25  
Scope: capabilities that matter for AI-agent autonomy, selfhost closure, and production-grade runtime trust.

Legend:
- `✅` production-capable and validated in active gates

## Competitive Positioning

- GenesisCode’s differentiator is integrated semantics: language runtime, semantic VCS, package manager, obligation/evidence pipeline, and deterministic replay model are one contract surface.
- It is stronger than mainstream stacks on agent verifiability (machine-readable CLI/GCPM reports, reproducible hashes, replay logs, policy gates, and assurance closures).
- It is weaker today on some “build anything immediately” host/runtime edges where first-party backends still expose partial or placeholder semantics (tracked below).

Known GenesisCode gaps identified in this audit (tracked in `/Users/corbensorenson/Documents/genesisCode/upgrade_plan.md`):
- `P0.1` - stage2 translation-validation still rejects valid CoreForm shapes and effectful result classes.
- `P0.2` - first-party backend bridge does not yet implement full `io/net::*` and `sys/process::*` lifecycle semantics.
- `P1.1` - deployment target bundles are deterministic wrappers, not full platform-native packagers.
- `P1.2` - backend bootstrap remains partially manual outside workspace-scaffolded runtime flows.
- `P1.3` - first-party plugin/ffi bridge support is still narrow relative to general ABI execution needs.
